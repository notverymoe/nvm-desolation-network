## Plot

You play a corporate drone longing for a life away from the company you've slaved away for the majority of your adult life. You've been saving and, when a family member passes, you find you're able to buy your freedom. A recently refurbished space station near a galactic shipping route is selling units, it seems safe, reputable and popular - so you invest your savings, quit your job and hop on the next transport.

Upon arrival you realise that you've been duped, along with a few other folk. The station is a scavenged husk and stuck in lockdown. Seeking legal action seems impossible as the seller appears to have disappeared into smoke and, between all of you, you barely have enough money to consult a lawyer. Instead of despairing, you come together and decide to make do with your situation. You will rebuild the station and claim the life you were promised with your own bare hands, as a community.

In the end, the player having no particular skillset, will be assigned to the farm in the terrestrial habitat. They will be able to grow crops, raise animals, buy machines and use some scavenged cyberjack equipment to literally dive into the station computer's corrupted cyberspace to debug and unlock new sections of the station. What will they discover in the bowels of the station? What secrets does the station's memory core contain? Will there be planetary excursions? We'll have to see!

(I intend for this game to be very queer. Very explicitly queer)
